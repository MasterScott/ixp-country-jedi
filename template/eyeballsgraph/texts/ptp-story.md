## Sketches of the Peer-to-Peer Fabric of a Country
    
The quality of end-user connections are often expressed in download speeds towards content providers. Instead, the sketches presented here focus on peer-to-peer connections in a country.
    
The sketches explore the different ways in which end-users are interconnected within the same country: the peer-to-peer fabric. Each sketch represents a snapshot of this fabric at a single given point in time. They try to provide insight into how networks interconnect their users.
    
These sketches are created with active measurements from the RIPE Atlas measurement platform, datasets from RIPEstat, AS-to-ORG datasets from CAIDA and a dataset from APNIC that estimates the percentage of end-users in each network.
