## Other Countries, some examples

Below are three examples of countries.

The first example is South Korea, where you see that a few large parties
handle most user-to-user connections and they interconnect directly,
with no other networks involved.

In the second example, Ireland, we see how an IXP facilitates a large
part of the user-to-user connections.

In the third example, Czech Republic, we see that there are a lot of
smaller parties that have users, and larger variety of intermediary
networks to facilitate the connections between users.
